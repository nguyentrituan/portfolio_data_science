# Hands-on: Online-Retail analytics pipeline

We will sit together and hands-on to put together what we have learnt to build a "workable" analytics pipeline. 
Besides, we learn by hands-on with several analytics techniques: Cohort analysis, RFM analysis, and Clustering.


## ðŸš© Toolings

- `dvc` to version and collaborate on datasets (raw, intermediate, metrics/insight layers)
- `Python` + `Jupyter Notebook` to do analysis, visualization, and modeling
- `git`: versioning code and collaborate
- `elyra`: create an analytics workflow
